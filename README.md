# Music-Classification
Music was classified using three supervised training and classification methods. Support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and desiscion tree algorithms were among the methods tested. 
#
5.5 GB of music data was used. A public music database shared by George Tzanetakis was used along with legally obtained music from my personal collections. 
#
In the first test, music from bands of different genres were classified. Music from Gucci Mane, Frederic Chopin, and Nirvana were used. In test two, music from artists within the same genre was classified, including Nirvana, Mastadon, and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. The third test aimed to classify music from various artists according to genre. For this test the Tzanetakis database was used including music from a range of genres, from which classical, hip-hop, and country were used. 
#
In each test, anywhere from 44 to 100 audio clips were used from each genre/artist, depending on the number of songs available. To determine the accuracy of each algorithm, 100 trials were run where all three alrogithms were trained, tested, and evaluated repeatedly. In each trial, 85% of the songs from each genre/artist were selected randomly and used as a training set, and the remaining 15% were used to test and validate the algorithms.

Due to copyright concerns the music used will not be provided, however upon request I can provide samples of free use music to use with the code.
